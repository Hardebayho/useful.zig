## useful.zig
This repository will host a collection of useful libraries I am writing for the zig programming language. This will range from platform abstractions, data structures (containers like Vec, Linked list and others) to networking, cryptography, multimedia, memory management and other useful stuff.

Some of the implementations here will overlap with the ones in the standard library. The idea is that I'm trying to make sure that people have a choice, and the standard library will not be the only option available for zig users.
